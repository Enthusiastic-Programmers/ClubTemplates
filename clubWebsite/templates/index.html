                        We are Enthusiastic Programmers at Moorpark College. This website is for any information about our club from announcments to event logistics; Come join our discord server too. We are a big group of young to older college students pursuing our passion of Computer Science. This past year of 2018/2019 has been amazing as we have met many new students, worked on projects, and attended many events,most called Hackathons where hunderds of students around the globe come together to bring ideas to life in a short span of 24 to 48 hours. A few of the hackathons that we have gone to in the fall semester include SDHacks, CalHacks, HackHarvard,  and SacHacks. Another enjoyable event we went to was DevFest LA, where several educational talks took place and raffle prizes were won. Another event where we try to compete at is the National ACM competition, where this past year our one team had placed 2nd out of all community colleges! Our club has three mettings ever week, Monday, Wednedsay, and Thursday from around 3p.m. - 6p.m. in the room LMC-121. It is open for any help or questions, and to plan events and any future projects. Anyone is welcome, no experience is needed at all! We hope to see some new people there.

                       This year many new members have joined our club as we provide help and guidance to those taking computer science classes. Additionally, many students are always thinking of new innovative ideas but sometimes are not sure where to start, and so we also help them get started with their ideas. A couple of the projects the club has worked on are one like this website(hackathon ideas, space balloon project). We have also worked on many project ideas at Hackathons. One of our main focus for the students in club is to attend Hackathons. These events are so amazing and fun and provide great chances for students to get involved to learn and make an idea actually happen, show off to real big companies for potential buisness or job opportunities, and meeting new great smart people to keep in contact with. Many big companies sponser these events, which help fund and make the event happen, but also these sponsers usually have categories in which the best project wins a variety of prizes! Below will be some links of more info on these actual Hackathon projects.
    </p>
    <p>
                       <span style="font-size: 24px"> HackHarvard: </span>  One project idea consisted of using a custom search and some machine learning tools, to gather the most trustworthy and factual information online, to help get rid of fake news across the web. Another project involved reading handwriting from a whiteboard, to make notes automatically during a lecture, without the need for an expensive smart board. It used OpenCV and Microsoft's Computer Vision API to detect people and translate writing into documents. 
    </p>
    <p>
                     <span style="font-size: 24px"> SacHacks: </span> One project was made to have a nice functional wevesite where people across the globe can post lost and found items, for owners to potentially get back anything they lost, or for people to post items they have found to get there way back home. This team won a prize category for best domain name, getting raspberry pi kits. Another teams idea was to utilize Google Cloud Platform machine learning tools, to create a program that would be able to identify a security threat in real time through video footage, and this team ended up winning the Google category prize and each member got a Google Home Mini. 
    </p>
    <p>
                      <span style="font-size: 24px"> CalHacks: </span> The team idea was to make a program that analyses RISC-V assembly language, to potentially find poor CPU cache performances and thus slow performance.
    </p>
    <p>
                     <span style="font-size: 24px">SDHacks: </span> The team had an idea to use a Myo armband, for a security authentication program, which the armband would detect gestures or other muscle activity from an arm. 
    </p>
    <p>
                     <span style="font-size: 24px">CruzHacks: </span> The team wanted to make a website to be able to share and rank all the Hackathons that go on year round.

                     We are so excited for these upcoming semesters to bring more students to our club for chances like going to these amazing events and making new amazing project ideas. Here is a list of Hackathons with open applications <span style="font-size: 25px">anyone</span> can apply to:

                        Clubs at Moorpark do not seem to have a central place for communication with members or anyone. This is our proposed solution to bring all clubs together at Moorpark, and to help those students get more information and access to the clubs they are interested in. On one of the tabs there is a sign-in for clubs to use, so we can start going green and save paper for member counts. There are many other things the Enthusiastic Programmers do even on a weekly basis during the meeting times. As of spring semester 2019, we hold meetings every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 3pm-6pm in the LMC-121. We have started some workshops such as going over Python and showing how to debug. Also for the computer architecture and organization class we have started a small workshop for helping with the assembly language and also debugging help as it is a huge importance in that class. There are many more workshops in the making to further help any students in the Computer Science field and even other fields like Game Design and Cyber Security. Along with posting meeting times and schedules, many future hackathons will be listed here with all details, to help inform any interested students. We dream that one day we can host our own Hackathon for local students.
