    <p>
                        This year many new members have joined our club as we provide help and guidance to those taking computer science classes. Additionally, many students are always thinking of new innovative ideas but sometimes are not sure where to start, and so we also help them get started with their ideas. A couple of the projects the club has worked on are one like this website(hackathon ideas, space balloon project). We have also worked on many project ideas at Hackathons. One of our main focus for the students in club is to attend Hackathons. These events are so amazing and fun and provide great chances for students to get involved to learn and make an idea actually happen, show off to real big companies for potential buisness or job opportunities, and meeting new great smart people to keep in contact with. Many big companies sponser these events, which help fund and make the event happen, but also these sponsers usually have categories in which the best project wins a variety of prizes! Below will be some links of more info on these actual Hackathon projects.

                        <span style="font-size: 24px"> HackHarvard: </span>  <a href="https://devpost.com/software/newsfactaggregator" >Project 1: </a> consisted of using a custom search and some machine learning tools, to gather the most trustworthy and factual information online, to help get rid of fake news across the web. <a  href="https://devpost.com/software/smartnotes-mfnshz" > Project 2:</a> involved reading handwriting from a whiteboard, to make notes automatically during a lecture, without the need for an expensive smart board. It used OpenCV and Microsoft's Computer Vision API to detect people and translate writing into documents.

                      <span style="font-size: 24px"> SacHacks: </span> <a href=" https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/sachacks/dashboard/767df74/submission/" > Project 1: </a> was made to have a nice functional website where people across the globe can post lost and found items, for owners to potentially get back anything they lost, or for people to post items they have found to get there way back home. This team won a prize category for best domain name, getting raspberry pi kits. <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/sachacks/dashboard/2dd4db2/submission/" > Project 2: </a> utilized Google Cloud Platform machine learning tools, to create a program that would be able to identify a security threat in real time through video footage, and this team ended up winning the Google category prize and each member got a Google Home Mini.

    <p>
                      <span style="font-size: 24px">SDHacks: </span> The team had an idea to use a Myo armband, for a security authentication program, which the armband would detect gestures or other muscle activity from an arm. 
    </p>
    <p>
                      <span style="font-size: 24px">CruzHacks: </span> The team wanted to make a website to be able to share and rank all the Hackathons that go on year round.

    <p>
        <span style="font-size: 24px">HackTech: </span> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/distraction-for-donation"> Project 1: </a> Get distracted too much when trying to focus? Use this chrome extenstion to help you focus more, by donating to charity for every 5 minutes you are distracted on other websites. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/seizure-flash-blocker"> Project 2: </a> can help with everyday life for people who may be susceptible to seizures or other related conditions, by blocking out visually photosensitvie/disturbing graphics to prevent the watcher from experincing anything bad.
