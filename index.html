                    We are Enthusiastic Programmers at Moorpark College. This website is for information about our club from announcments, event logistics, 
                    and join our discord. This past year of 2018/2019 we have attended many events called Hackathons, where hunderds of students around the globe
                    come together to bring ideas to life in a short span of 24-48 hours. Some that we have gone to in the fall include SDHacks, CalHacks, HackHarvard,  and SacHacks. 
                   These events are so amazing and fun, and the sponsors at these events provide a chance for prizes. A group that went to SacHacks, won individual Google Home Mini's for
                   the category prize for using Google Cloud Platform! We are excited for these upcoming semesters to bring more students to these amazing events, and continue to share
                    the awesome knowledge of Computer Science!
                    <!--INFO: This is the part of the website where we figure out what to introduce about our club. -->
                </p>
                <p> Clubs at Moorpark do not seem to have a central place for communication with members. This is our proposed solution to bring all clubs together
                    at Moorpark, and to help those students get more information and access to the clubs they are interested in. There is a sign-in for clubs to use, so we can start going 
                    green and saving some paper. Hackathons are another main focus for students in our club. They are such great opportunities to learn, meet new friends, and even for job offers. 
                    Future hackathons will be listed here with all details, to help inform any interested students. We dream that one day we can host our own Hackathon 
                    for local students. 
                    <!--This is the part where we write what this club is about and what this website can be potentially used for. -->
                </p>
                <p> This website is a big project for our club that we have worked on, and continue to update and make useful for Moorpark students. Other priojects the club works on will be listed here. Hackathons we have gone to, and any cool
                    stuff like winning prize, job offers will be listed here.  
                    <!--This is the part where we write what we have done as a club in the past, and what we are currently working on. like this website for instance.-->
                </p>
                <p> We are always planning to go to events, so future hackathons where we want to go will be listed here. Students are always coming up with new ideas, so
                    any new project ideas will be listed here to inform anyone interested. 
                    <!--This is the part where we write about what the club plans to do in the future, either events or future projects, like hackathons or like this website project. -->
